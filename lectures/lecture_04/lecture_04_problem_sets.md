# Functions - Problem Set

### **Exercise 1: Greeting Function**
Write a function called `greet_user(name)` that takes a person's name as a parameter and prints a greeting message.


```python
# Your code
```

### **Exercise 2: Sum of Two Numbers**
Create a function called `sum_two_numbers(a, b)` that takes two numbers as arguments and returns their sum.


```python
# Your code
```

### **Exercise 3: Convert Celsius to Fahrenheit**
Write a function `celsius_to_fahrenheit(celsius)` that takes a temperature in Celsius and returns the temperature in Fahrenheit. Use the formula:

$$ 
    F = \frac{9}{5} \times C + 32
$$


```python
# Your code
```

### **Exercise 4: Calculate Area of Circle**
Create a function called `calculate_circle_area(radius)` that takes the radius of a circle and returns the area of the circle using the formula:

$$
    A = \pi \times r^2
$$


```python
# Your code
```

### **Exercise 5: Simple Interest**
Write a function `calculate_simple_interest(principal, rate, time)` that calculates simple interest and returns it. The formula is:

$$
    \text{Interest} = \frac{P \times R \times T}{100}
$$


```python
# Your code
```

### **Exercise 6: Compound Interest**
Modify the function `calculate_compound_interest(principal, rate, time)` to return both the compound interest and the total amount (principal + interest).


```python
# Your code
```

### **Exercise 7: Maximum of Three Numbers**
Create a function `max_of_three(a, b, c)` that takes three numbers as input and returns the largest of the three.


```python
# Your code
```

### **Exercise 8: Check Even or Odd with Lambda**
Use a lambda function to check whether a number is even or odd. Write a function `is_even_or_odd(number)` that returns "even" if the number is even and "odd" if the number is odd.


```python
# Your code
```

### **Exercise 9: Sum of Squares using map()**
Use `map()` and a lambda function to create a list of squares of numbers from 1 to 10.


```python
# Your code
```

### **Exercise 10: Filter Positive Numbers**
Write a function `filter_positive(numbers)` that takes a list of numbers and uses the `filter()` function to return a list of only positive numbers.


```python
# Your code
```

### **Advanced Exercise 1: Recursive Factorial Function**
Write a recursive function `factorial(n)` that takes a number `n` and returns the factorial of `n`.


```python
# Your code
```

### **Advanced Exercise 2: Higher-Order Function for Applying Functions**
Create a higher-order function `apply_function(func, x)` that takes a function and a value `x`, and applies the function to `x` twice.


```python
# Your code
```

### **Advanced Exercise 3: Net Present Value (NPV) with Lambda**
Write a function `calculate_npv(cash_flows, rate)` that calculates the Net Present Value (NPV) of cash flows using a lambda function inside a list comprehension. Assume `cash_flows` is a list and `rate` is a constant discount rate.


```python
# Your code
```

### **Advanced Exercise 4: Zip and Sort**
Write a function `zip_and_sort(names, scores)` that takes two lists: `names` (list of students' names) and `scores` (list of their scores). Use `zip()` to combine the two lists into tuples, then return the list of students sorted by their scores in descending order.


```python
# Your code
```

### **Advanced Exercise 5: Reduce for Cumulative Product**
Use the `reduce()` function to write a function `cumulative_product(numbers)` that takes a list of numbers and returns their cumulative product.


```python
# Your code
```
